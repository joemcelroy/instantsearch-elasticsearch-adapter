# Overview

InstantSearch Elasticsearch Adapter is a javascript library that lets you use Elasticsearch with Algolia's Instantsearch, a javascript library for building performant and instant search experiences.

## How it works

![overview](../public/ises-overview.png)

The adapter provides two public libraries:

- [Node API](./reference/api) which transforms instantsearch requests into Elasticsearch queries
- [Browser client](./reference/client) that integrates with the instantsearch library and the Adapter's node API

With the adapter, you'll be able to use instantsearch frameworks to quickly build great search experiences with **Elasticsearch**.
