### Installation

It is available as `@ises/client` on npm.

```sh
npm install @ises/client
# or
yarn add @ises/client
```

Then import it in your project:

```js
import Client from "@ises/client";
```

### Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use the client to use React Instantsearch with Instantsearch Elasticsearch adapter.

Node API route has been setup under `/api/search` and the client is used to fetch the results from the API.

```tsx
const searchClient = Client({
  // the url of your instantsearch-elasticsearch-adapter API endpoint
  url: "/api/search",
});

export default function Web() {
  return (
    <div className="ais-InstantSearch">
      <InstantSearch indexName="imdb_movies" searchClient={searchClient}>
        <SearchBox />
        <Hits />
      </InstantSearch>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Headers

You can pass headers to the client to be sent with each request.

```js
const searchClient = Client({
  url: "/api/search",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "my-api-key",
  },
});
```

or you can pass a function that returns headers.

```js
const searchClient = Client({
  url: "/api/search",
  headers: () => ({
    auth: "Bearer" + window.localStorage.getItem("token"),
  }),
});
```
